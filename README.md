# The Space Object Ontology (SOO)
The SOO is an ontology of objects in the space environment beyond Earths atmosphere. The minimum scope/focus is on objects in orbit of Earth. It represents different sorts of space object, such as orbital debris, asteroids, spacecraft, etc., and the relationships between them. Because the space situational awareness community focuses on the environment surrounding Earth and therefore of objects in that enviornment, this ontology (or its classes) may be part of (or imported into) the broader Space Situational Awareness Domain Ontology (SSAO). Alternatively, each taking on a narrow scope, may be part of the broder Orbital Space Environment Domain Ontology (OSEDO) or Orbital Space Ontology (see my github repository for working conceptualizations, and [1][2][3]). (NOTE: These are domain delineations and modular architectures under consideration; as such, this ontology is subject to revision.)  If you find value in my work, please [support/donate here](https://gogetfunding.com/creating-meaning-full-space-terminologies-knowledge-models-for-space-safety/).

## Status
No claims to completeness are made. Ontology subject to revision. Lack of development is due to lack of opportunity to sustainably work on it. The author seeks: funded degree fellowships for this overall project as a thesis; employment; team; professors to apply to grants for the project; etc. Please contact me if you are interested in cooperative partnerships, co-authoring, etc.

Seeking opportunities to sustainably develop this long-standing project. Seeking...
* funding, 
* partners/colleagues/co-workers/collaborators
* PhD or MS fellowship, or 
* a employment or job
...to realize the concept

CONTEXT: The overall concept has been a pursuit since 2011 (see my orbital debris ontology repository) (Documentation, including references, verifying this five-year ideation is available upon request). Since then I've been seeking a sustainable opportunity (employment, PhD post, research position, etc.) to work on, develop, and implement this with others. I have developed a number of papers on this to make it a Phd project. Interested potential co-authors are welcome to contact me.
