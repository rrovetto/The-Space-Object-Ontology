# The Space Object Ontology (SOO)
The SOO is an ontology of objects in the space environment beyond Earths atmosphere. The focus is on objects in orbit of, or near, Earth. It represents different sorts of space object, such as orbital debris, and asteroids, and the relationships between them. Because the space object (or space situational awareness) community focuses on the environment surrounding Earth and awareness of objects in that enviornment, this ontology is a Space Situational Awareness Ontology (SSAO)--see my other repository. 

##Note##
Given this, given the domain, synonymous names include: 'space domain ontology' (SDO), and 'space object object' (SOO). As I've conceived it thus far, SDO is most general, followed by SSAO, and then SOO. With the ontology name, SOO focuses on object, whereas the others allow for more entities.

##Status##
Seeking opportunities to sustainably develop this long-standing project. Seeking...
* funding, 
* partners/colleagues/co-workers/collaborators
* PhD or MS fellowship, or 
* a employment or job

...to realize the concept

##Historical Context
The overall concept has been a pursuit since 2011 (see my orbital debris ontology repository) (Documentation, including references, verifying this five-year ideation is available upon request). Since then I've been seeking a sustainable opportunity (employment, PhD post, research position, etc.) to work on, develop, and implement this with others. I have developed a number of papers on this to make it a Phd project. Interested potential co-authors are welcome to contact me.
