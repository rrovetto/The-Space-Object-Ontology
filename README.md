# The Space Object Ontology (SOO)
An ontology describing objects in the outer space environment.
## Description
See also the Ontology Requirements Specification Document (purchase link coming soon).

### Scope

The SOO is an ontology of objects in the space environment beyond Earths atmosphere, i.e. exoatmospheric space environments. The minimum scope/focus is on objects in orbit of Earth. It represents different sorts of space object, such as orbital debris, asteroids, spacecraft, etc., and the relationships between them. Because the space situational awareness community focuses on the environment surrounding Earth and therefore of objects in that enviornment, this ontology (or its classes) may be part of (or imported into) the broader Space Situational Awareness Domain Ontology (SSAO). Alternatively, each taking on a narrow scope, may be part of the broder Orbital Space Environment Domain Ontology (OSEDO) or Orbital Space Ontology (see my github repository for working conceptualizations, and [1][2][3]). (NOTE: These are domain delineations and modular architectures under consideration; as such, this ontology is subject to revision.)  If you find value in my work, please [support/donate here](https://gogetfunding.com/creating-meaning-full-space-terminologies-knowledge-models-for-space-safety/).

### Architecture
A self-contained module, usable by itself, but also part of the author's wider [space domain knowledge modeling](https://purl.org/space-ontology) suite of ontologies and other knowledge organization systems.

### Status
* In-progress as circumstances permit. Subject to revision. Lack of development is due to lack of opportunity to sustainably work on it.
* As a unfunded personal project since inception, continued development is dependent on circumstances. Formal support is needed to complete and sustain development to realize the full project vision. The vision is ambitious, multidisciplinary and detailed. [Contact the author](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact) to formally support the project in some way. Donations are welcome at the below web-links.  
* ACTIVELY NEEDING: financial support, employer support, stable environment with resources to development and continue learning, etc.
* Desired as my PhD or other graduate project

## Support / Contribute / Desiderata - How you can help 
As an unfunded personal project, you can help by offerring financial support, employment opportunities, graduate study opportunities whereby this can be part of my thesis or projects, co-authorship on papers or proposal, mentorship, voluntary technical expertise/servies for desired functionalities of my project, relevant datasets to apply the ontology to, and to be a user of the ontology(s).
